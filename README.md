# Business Description
Danny's Diner is a Japanese restaurant that sells Danny's favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

# Business Problem
The restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business. These data are to be used to answer questions about Danny's custmers especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favour. 

This understanding will help him deliver and keep up with customers demands. To help with this, by keeping the business afloat, I need to provide answers to Danny's business questions.

# Entity Relationship Diagram
In this case study, three datasets were presented by Danny to solve the business challenge. The datasets are: sales, menu, and members.
The diagram below shows the entity relationship between the datasets.

# Business Description
Danny's Pizza Empire was born from his numerous scrolls on instagram. During one of his numerous scrolls “80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!” caught his eye. But he knew pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire. He decided to combine that with delivery and so Pizza Runner was launched!

# Business Problem
Because Danny had a few years of experience as a data scientist - he was very aware that data collection was going to be critical for his business’ growth. He prepared an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner’s operations.


# Entity Relationship Diagram
In this case study, six datasets were presented by Danny to solve the business challenge. The datasets are: runners, customer_orders, runner_orders, pizza_names, pizza_recipes, pizza_toppings.
The diagram below shows the entity relationship between the datasets.
