# Business Description
Danny's Pizza Empire was born from his numerous scrolls on instagram. During one of his numerous scrolls “80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!” caught his eye. But he knew pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire. He decided to combine that with delivery and so Pizza Runner was launched!

# Business Problem
Because Danny had a few years of experience as a data scientist - he was very aware that data collection was going to be critical for his business’ growth. He prepared an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner’s operations.


# Entity Relationship Diagram
In this case study, six datasets were presented by Danny to solve the business challenge. The datasets are: runners, customer_orders, runner_orders, pizza_names, pizza_recipes, pizza_toppings.
The diagram below shows the entity relationship between the datasets.
