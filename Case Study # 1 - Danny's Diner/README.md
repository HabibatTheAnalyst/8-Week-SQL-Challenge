# Business Description
Danny's Diner is a Japanese restaurant that sells Danny's favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

# Business Problem
The restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business. These data are to be used to answer questions about Danny's custmers especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favour. 
U
This understanding will help him deliver and keep up with customers demands. To help with this, by keeping the business afloat, I need to provide answers to Danny's business questions.

# Datasets
In this case study, three key datasets were presented by Danny to solve the business challenge.
The datasets are: sales, menu, and members.

* ### sales:
The sales table captures all "customer_id" level purchases with an corresponding "order_date" and "product_id" information for when and what menu items were ordered.

* ### menu:
The menu table maps the "product_id" to the actual "product_name" and price of each menu item.

* ### members:
The final members table captures the "join_date" when a "customer_id" joined the beta version of the Danny’s Diner loyalty program.
